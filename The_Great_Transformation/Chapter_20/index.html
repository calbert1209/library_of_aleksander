  <h1>Chapter 20</h1>

<p>20</p>
<p>HISTORY IN THE GEAR OF SOCIAL CHANGE</p>
<p>If ever there was a political movement that responded to the needs of an objective situation and was not a result of fortuitous causes it was fascism. At the same time, the degenerative character of the fascist solution was evident. It offered an escape from an institutional deadlock which was essentially alike in a large number of countries, and yet, if the remedy were tried, it would everywhere produce sickness unto death. That is the manner in which civilizations perish.</p>
<p>The fascist solution of the impasse reached by liberal capitalism can be described as a reform of market economy achieved at the price of the extirpation of all democratic institutions, both in the industrial and in the political realm. The economic system which was in peril of disruption would thus be revitalized, while the people themselves were subjected to a re-education designed to denaturalize the individual and make him unable to function as the responsible unit of the body politic.^ This re-education, comprising the tenets of a political religion that denied the idea of the brotherhood of man in all its forms, was achieved through an act of mass conversion enforced against recalcitrants by scientific methods of torture.</p>
<p>The appearance of such a movement in the industrial countries of the globe, and even in a number of only slightly industrialized ones, should never have been ascribed to local causes, national mentalities, or historical backgrounds as was so consistently done by contemporaries. Fascism had as little to do with the Great War as with the Versailles Treaty, with Junker militarism as with the Italian temperament. The movement appeared in defeated countries like Bulgaria and in victorious ones like Jugoslavia, in countries of Northern temperament like Finland and Norway and of Southern temperament like Italy and Spain, in countries of Aryan race like England, Ireland, or Belgium and non-Aryan race like Japan, Hungary or Palestine, in countries of Catholic traditions like Portugal and in Protestant ones like Holland, in soldierly communities like Prussia and civilian ones like Austria, in old cultures like France and new ones like the United States and the Latin-American countries. In fact, there was no type of background —
of religious, cultural, or national tradition — that made a country immune to fascism, once the conditions for its emergence were given.</p>
<p>Moreover, there was a striking lack of relationship between its material and numerical strength and its political effectiveness. The very term “movement” was misleading since it implied some kind of enrollment or personal participation of large numbers. If anything was characteristic of fascism it was its independence of such popular manifestations. Though usually aiming at a mass following, its potential strength was reckoned not by the numbers of its adherents but by the influence of the persons in high position whose good will the fascist leaders possessed, and whose influence in the community could be coxmted upon to shelter them from the consequences of an abortive revolt, thus taking the risks out of revolution.</p>
<p>A country approaching the fascist phase showed symptoms among which the existence of a fascist movement proper was not necessarily one. At least as important signs were the spread of irrationalistic philosophies, racialist esthetics, anticapitalistic demagogy, heterodox currency views, criticism of the party system, widespread disparagement of the “regime,” or whatever was the name given to the existing demo cratic set-up. In Austria the so-called universalist philosophy of Othmar Spann, in Germany the poetry of Stephan George and the cosmogonic romanticism of Ludwig Klages, in England D. H. Lawrence’s erotic vitalism, in France Georges Sorel’s cult of the political myth were among its extremely diverse forerunners. Hitler was eventually put in power by the feudalist clique around President Hindenburg, just as Mussolini and Primo de Rivera were ushered into office by their respective sovereigns. Yet Hitler had a vast movement to support him ;
Mussolini had a small one ; Primo de Rivera had none. In no case was an actual revolution against constituted authority launched; fascist tactics were invariably those of a sham rebellion arranged with the tacit approval of the authorities who pretended to have been overwhelmed by force. These are the bare outlines of a complex picture in which room would have to be made for figures as diverse as the Catholic free-lance demagogue in industrial Detroit, the “Kingfish” in backward Louisiana, Japanese army conspirators, and Ukrainian anti-Soviet saboteurs. Fascism was an ever given political possibility, an almost instantaneous emotional reaction in every industrial community since the 1930’s. One may call it a “move” in preference to a “movement,” to indicate the impersonal nature of the crisis the symptoms of which were frequently vague and ambiguous. People often did not feel sure whether a political speech or a play, a sermon or a public parade, a metaphysics or an artistic fashion, a poem or a party program was fascist or not. There were no accepted criteria of fascism, nor did it possess conventional tenets. Yet one significant feature of all its organized forms was the abruptness with which they appeared and faded out again, only to burst forth with violence after an indefinite period of latency. All this fits into the picture of a social force that waxed and waned according to the objective situation.</p>
<p>What we termed, for short, “fascist situation” was no other than the typical occasion of easy and complete fascist victories. All at once, the tremendous industrial and political organizations of labor and of other devoted upholders of constitutional freedom would melt away, and minute fascist forces would brush aside what seemed until then the overwhelming strength of democratic governments, parties, trade unions. If a “revolutionary situation” is characterized by the psychological and moral disintegration of all forces of resistance to the point where a handful of scantily armed rebels were enabled to storm the supposedly impregnable strongholds of reaction, then the “fascist situation” was its complete parallel except for the fact that here the bulwarks of democracy and constitutional liberties were stormed and their defenses found wanting in the same spectacular fashion. In Prussia, in July, 1932, the legal government of the Social Democrats, entrenched in the seat of legitimate power, capitulated to the mere threat of unconstitutional violence on the part of Herr von Papen. Some six months later Hitler possessed himself peacefully of the highest positions of power, whence he at once launched a revolutionary attack of wholesale destruction against the institutions of the Weimar Republic and the constitutional parties. To imagine that it was the strength of the movement which created situations such as these, and not to see that it was the situation that gave birth in this case to the movement, is to miss the outstanding lesson of the last decades.</p>
<p>Fascism, like socialism, was rooted in a market society that refused to function. Hence, it was world-wide, catholic in scope, universal in application ; the issues transcended the economic sphere and begot a general transformation of a distinctively social kind. It radiated into almost every field of human activity whether political or economic, cultural, philosophic, artistic, or religious. And up to a point it coalesced with local and topical tendencies. No understanding of the'
history of the period is possible unless we distinguish between the underlying fascist move and the ephemeral tendencies with which that move fused in different countries.</p>
<p>In the Europe of the twenties two such tendencies figured prominently and overlay the fainter but vastly more comprehensive pattern of fascism : counterrevolution and nationalist revisionism. Their immediate starting point was the Treaties and the postwar revolutions. Though strictly conditioned, and limited to their specific objectives, they were easily confounded with fascism.</p>
<p>Counterrevolutions were the usual backswing of the political pendulum towards a state of affairs that had been violently disturbed. Such moves have been typical in Europe at least since the English Commonwealth, and had but limited connection with the social processes of their time. In the twenties numerous situations of this kind developed, since the upheavals that destroyed more than a dozen thrones in Central and Eastern Europe were partly due to the backwash of defeat, not to the forward move of democracy. The job of counterrevolution was mainly political and fell as a matter of course to the dispossessed classes and groups such as dynasties, aristocracies, churches, heavy industries, and the parties affiliated with them. The alliances and clashes of conservatives and fascists during this period concerned mainly the share that should go to the fascists in the counterrevolutionary undertaking. Now, fascism was a revolutionary tendency directed as much against conservatism cis against the competing revolutionary force of socialism. That did not preclude the fascists from seeking power in the political field by offering their services to the counterrevolution. On the contrary, they claimed ascendency chiefly by virtue of the alleged impotence of conservatism to accomplish that job, which was unavoidable if socialism was to be barred. The conservatives, naturally, tried to monopolize the honors of the counterrevolution and, actually, as in Germany, accomplished it alone. They deprived the working-class parties of influence and power, without giving in to the Nazi. Similarly, in Austria, the Christian Socialists — a conservative party — largely disarmed the workers {1927) without making any concession to the “revolution from the right.” Even where fascist participation in the counterrevolution was unavoidable, “strong” governments were established which relegated fascism to the limbo. This happened in Esthonia in 1929, in Finland in 1932, in Latvia in 1934Pseudo-liberal regimes broke the power of fascism for the time, in</p>
<p>Hungary in 1922, and in Bulgaria in 1926. In Italy alone were the conservatives unable to restore work-discipline in industry without providing the fascists with a chance of gaming power.</p>
<p>In the militarily defeated countries, but also in the “psychologically” defeated Italy, the national problem loomed large. Here a task was set the stringency of which could not be denied. Deeper than all other issues cut the permanent disarmament of the defeated countries ;
in a world in which the only existing organization of international law, international order, and international peace rested on the balance of power, a number of countries had been made powerless without any intimation of the kind of system that would replace the old. The League of Nations represented, at the best, an improved system of balance of power, but was actually not even on the level of the late Concert of Europe, since the prerequisite of a general diffusion of power was now lacking. The nascent fascist movement put itself almost everywhere into the service of the national issue ; it could hardly have survived without this “pick-up” job.</p>
<p>Yet, it used this issue only as a stepping stone; at other times it struck the pacifist and isolationist note. In England and the United States it was allied with appeasement; in Austria the Heimwehr cooperated with sundry Catholic pacifists ; and Catholic fascism was antinationalist, on principle. Huey Long needed no border conflict with Mississippi or Texas to launch his fascist movement from Baton Rouge. Similar movements in Holland and Norway were nonnationalist to the point of treason — Quisling may have been a name for a good fascist, but was certainly not one for a good patriot.</p>
<p>In its struggle for political power fascism is entirely free to disregard or to use local issues, at will. Its aim transcends the political and economic framework : it is social. It puts a political religion into the service of a degenerative process. In its rise it excludes only a very few emotions from its orchestra; yet once victorious it bars from the band wagon all but a very small group of motivations, though again extremely characteristic ones. Unless we distinguish closely between this pseudo intolerance on the road to power and the genuine intolerance in power, we can hardly hope to understand the subtle but decisive difference between the sham-nationalism of some fascist movements during the revolution, and the specifically imperialistic nonnaffonalism which they developed after the revolution.*</p>
<p>While conservatives were as a rule successful in carrying the domestic counterrevolutions alone, they were but rarely able to bring the national-international problem of their countries to an issue. Briining maintained in 1940 that German reparations and disarmament had been solved by him before the “clique around Hindenburg” decided to put him out of office and to hand over power to the Nazis, the reason for their action being that they did not want the honors to go to him.®
Whether, in a very limited sense, this was so or not seems immaterial, since the question of Germany’s equality of status was not restricted to technical disarmament, as Bruning implied, but included the equally vital question of demilitarization ; also, it was not really possible to disregard the strength which German diplomacy drew from the existence of Nazi masses sworn to radical nationalist policies. Events proved conclusively that Germany’s equality of status could not have been attained without a revolutionary departure, and it is in this light that the awful responsibility of Nazism, which committed a free and equal Germany to a career of crime, becomes apparent. Both in Germany and in Italy fascism could seize power only because it was able to use as its lever unsolved national issues, while in France as in Great Britain fascism was decisively weakened by its antipatriotism. Only in small and naturally dependent countries could the spirit of subservience to a foreign power prove an asset to fascism.</p>
<p>By accident only, as we see, was European fascism in the twenties connected with national and counterrevolutionary tendencies. It was a case of symbiosis between movements of independent origin, which reinforced one another and created the impression of essential similarity, while being actually unrelated.</p>
<p>In reality, the part played by fascism was determined by one factor: the condition of the market system.</p>
<p>During the period 1917-23 governments occasionally sought fascist help to restore law and order; no more was needed to set the market system going. Fascism remained undeveloped.</p>
<p>In the period 1924—29, when the restoration of the market system seemed ensured, fascism faded out as a political force altogether.</p>
<p>After 1930 market economy was in a general crisis. Within a few years fascism was a world power.</p>
<p>The first period 1917-23 produced hardly more than the term. In a number of European countries — such as Finland, Lithuania, Esthonia, Latvia, Poland, Roumania, Bulgaria, Greece, and Hungary — agrarian or socialist revolutions had taken place, while in others — among them Italy, Germany, and Austria — the industrial working class had gained political influence. Eventually counterrevolutions restored the domestic balance of power. In the majority of countries the peasantry turned against the urban workers; in some countries fascist movements were started by officers and gentry, who gave a lead to the peasantry ; in others, as in Italy, the unemployed and the petite bourgeoisie formed into fascist troops. Nowhere was any other issue than that of law and order mooted, no question of radical reform was raised; in other words, no sign of a fascist revolution was apparent. These movements were fascist only in form, that is to say only in so far as civilian bands, so-called irresponsible elements, made use of force and violence with the connivance of persons in authority. The antidemocratic philosophy of fascism was already born, but was not as yet a political factor. Trotsky gave a voluminous report on the situation in Italy on the eve of the Second Congress of the Comintern, in 1920, but did not even mention fascism, although fasci had been in existence for some time. It took another ten years or more before Italian fascism, long since established in the government of the country, developed anything in the nature of a distinctive social system.</p>
<p>In 1924 and after, Europe and the United States were the scene of a boisterous boom that drowned all concern for the soundness of the market system. Capitalism was proclaimed restored. Both Bolshevism and fascism were liquidated except in peripheric regions. The Comintern declared the consolidation of capitalism a fact ; Mussolini eulogized liberal capitalism ; all important countries except Great Britain were on the upgrade. The United States enjoyed a legendary prosperity, and the Continent was doing almost as well. Hitler’s putsch had been quashed; France had evacuated the Ruhr; the Reichsmark was restored as by miracle ; the Dawes Plan had taken politics out of reparations; Locarno was in the offing; and Germany was starting out on seven fat years. Before the end of 1926 the gold standard ruled again from Moscow to Lisbon.</p>
<p>It was in the third period — after 1929 — ^that the true significance^
of fascism became apparent. The deadlock of the market system was evident. Until then fascism had been hardly more than a trait in Italy’s authoritarian government, which otherwise differed but little from those of a more traditional type. It now emerged as an alternative solution of the problem of an industrial society. Germany took the lead in a revolution of European scope and the fascist alignment provided her struggle for power with a dynamics which soon embraced five continents. History was in the gear of social change.</p>
<p>An adventitious but by no means accidental event started the destruction of the international system. A Wall Street slump grew to huge dimensions and was followed by Great Britain’s decision to go off gold and, another two years later, by a similar move on the part of the United States. Concurrently, the Disarmament Conference ceased to meet, and, in 1934, Germany left the League of Nations.</p>
<p>These symbolic events ushered in an epoch of spectacular change in the organization of the world. Three powers, Japan, Germany, and Italy, rebelled against the status quo and sabotaged the crumbling institutions of peace. At the same time the factual organization of world economy refused to function. The gold standard was at least temporarily put out of action by its Anglo-Saxon creators ; under the guise of default, foreign debts were repudiated; capital markets and world trade dwindled away. The political and the economic system of the planet disintegrated conjointly.</p>
<p>Within the nations themselves the change was no less thorough. Two-party systems were superseded by one-party governments, sometimes by national governments. However, external similarities between dictatorship countries and countries which retained a democratic public opinion merely served to emphasize the superlative importance of free institutions of discussion and decision. Russia turned to socialism under dictatorial forms. Liberal capitalism disappeared in the countries prepeuing for war like Germany, Japan, and Italy, and, to a lesser extent, also in the United States and Great Britain. But the emerging regimes of fascism, socialism, and the New Deal were similar only in discarding laissez-faire principles.</p>
<p>While history was thus started on its course by an event external to aU, the single nations reacted to the challenge according to whither they were bound. Some were averse to change ; some went a long way to meet it when it came; some were indifferent. Also, they sought for solutions in various directions. Yet from the point of view of market economy these often radically different solutions merely represented given alternatives.</p>
<p>Among those determined to make use of a general dislocation to further their own interests was a group of dissatisfied Powers for whom the passing of the balance-of-power system, even in its weakened form of the League, appeared to offer a rare chance. Germany was now eager to hasten the downfall of traditional world economy, which still provided international order with a foothold, and she anticipated the collapse of that economy, so as to have the start of her opponents. She deliberately cut loose from the international system of capital, commodity, and currency so as to lessen the hold of the outer world upon her when she would deem it convenient to repudiate her political obligations. She fostered economic autarchy to ensure the freedom required for her far-reaching plans. She squandered her gold reserves, destroyed her foreign credit by gratuitous repudiation of her obligations and even, for a time, wiped out her favorable foreign trade balance. She easily managed to camouflage her true intentions since neither Wall Street nor the City of London nor Geneva suspected that the Nazis were actually banking on the final dissolution of nineteenth century economy. Sir John Simon and Montagu Norman firmly believed that eventually Schacht would restore orthodox economics in Germany, which was acting under duress and which would return to the fold, if she were only assisted financially. Illusions such as these survived in Downing Street up to the time of Munich and after. While Germany was thus greatly assisted in her conspirative plans by her ability to adjust to the dissolution of the traditional system. Great Britain found herself severely handicapped by her adherence to that system.</p>
<p>Although England had temporarily gone off gold, her economy and finance continued to be based on the principles of stable exchanges and sound currency. Hence, the limitations under which she found herself in respect to rearmament. Just as German autarchy was an outcome of military and political considerations that sprang from her intent to forestall a general transformation, Britain’s strategy and foreign policy were constricted by her conservative financial outlook. The strategy of limited warfare reflected the view of an island emporium, which regards itself safe as long as its Navy is strong enough to secure the supplies that its sound money can buy in the Seven Seas. Hitler was already in power when, in 1933, Duff Cooper, a die-hard, defended the cuts in the army budget of 1932 as made “in the face of the national bankruptcy, which was then thought to be an even greater danger than having an inefficient fighting service.” More than three years later Lord Halifax maintained that peace could be had by economic adjustments and that there should be no interference with trade since this would make such adjustments more difficult. In the very year of Munich, Halifax and Chamberlain still formulated Britain’s policy in terms of “silver bullets” and the traditional American loans for Germany. Indeed, even after Hitler had crossed the Rubicon and had occupied Prague, Lord Simon approved in the House of Commons of Montagu Norman’s part in the handing over of the Czech gold reserves to Hitler. It was Simon’s conviction that the integrity of the gold standard, to the restoration of which his statesmanship was dedicated, outweighed aU other considerations. Contemporaries believed that Simon’s action was the result of a determined policy of appeasement. Actually, it was an homage to the spirit of the gold standard, which continued to govern the outlook of the leading men of the City of London on strategic as well as on political matters. In the very week of the outbreak of the war the Foreign Office, in answer to a verbal communication of Hitler to Chamberlain, formulated Britain’s policy in terms of the traditional American loans for Germany.^ England’s military unpreparedness was mainly the result of her adherence to gold standard economics.</p>
<p>Germany at first reaped the advantages of those who kill that which is doomed to die. Her start lasted as long as the liquidation of the outworn system of the nineteenth century permitted her to keep in the lead. The destruction of liberal capitalism, of the gold standard, and of absolute sovereignties was the incidental result of her marauding raids. In adjusting to an isolation sought by herself and, later, in the course of her slave dealer’s expeditions, she developed tentative solutions to some problems of the transformation.</p>
<p>Her greatest political asset, however, lay in her ability to compel the countries of the world into an alignment against Bolshevism. She made herself the foremost beneficiary of the transformation by taking the lead in that solution of the problem of market economy which for a long time appeared to enlist the unconditional allegiance of the propertied classes, and indeed not always of these alone. Under the liberal and Marxist assumption of the primacy of economic class interests. Hitler was bound to win. But the social unit of the nation proved, in the long run, even more relevant than the economic unit of class.</p>
<p>Russia’s rise also was linked with her role in the transformation. From 1917 to 1929 the fear of Bolshevism was no more than the fear of disorder which might fatally hamper the restoration of a market economy which could not function except in an atmosphere of unqualified confidence. In the following decade socialism became a reality in Russia. The collectivization of the farms meant the supersession of market economy by co-operative methods in regard to the decisive factor of land. Russia, which had been merely a seat of revolutionary agitation directed towards the capitalistic world, now emerged as the representative of a new system which could replace market economy.</p>
<p>It is not usually realized that the Bolsheviks, though ardent socialists themselves, stubbornly refused to “establish socialism in Russia.”
Their Marxist convictions alone would have precluded such an attempt in a backward agrarian country. But apart from the entirely exceptional episode of so-called “War Communism” in 1920, the leaders adhered to the position that the world revolution must start in industrialized Western Europe. Socialism in one country would have appeared to them a contradiction in terms, and when it became reality, the Old Bolsheviks rejected it almost to a man. Yet it was precisely this departure which proved an amazing success.</p>
<p>Looking back upon a quarter century of Russian history it appears that what we call the Russian Revolution really consisted of two separate revolutions, the first of which embodied traditional Western European ideals, while the second formed part of the utterly new development of the thirties. The Revolution of 1917-24 was indeed the last of the political upheavals in Europe that followed the pattern of the English Commonwealth and of the French Revolution; the revolution that started with the collectivization of the farms, about 1930, was the first of the great social changes that transformed our world in the thirties. For the first Russian Revolution achieved the destruction of absolutism, feudal land tenure, and racial oppression —
a true heir to the ideals of 1789; the second Revolution established a socialist economy. When all is said, the first was merely a Russian event — it fulfilled a long process of Western development on Russian soil — while the second formed part of a simultaneous universal transformation.</p>
<p>Seemingly in the twenties Russia stood apart from Europe and was working out her own salvation. A closer analysis might disprove this appearance. For among the factors which forced upon her a decision in the years between the two revolutions was the failure of the international system. By 1924 “War Communism” was a forgotten incident and Russia had re-established a free domestic grain market, while maintaining state control of foreign trade and key industries. She was now bent on increasing her foreign trade, which depended mainly on exports of grain, timber, furs, and some other organic raw materials, the prices of which were slumping heavily in the course of the agrarian depression which preceded the general break in trade. Russia’s in-ability to develop an export trade on favorable terms restricted her imports of machinery and hence the establishment of a national industry ; this, again, affected the terms of barter between town and countryside — the so-called “scissors” — unfavorably, thus increasing the antagonism of the peasantry to the rule of the urban workers. In this way the disintegration of world economy increased the strain on the makeshift solutions of the agrarian question in Russia, and hastened the coming of the kolkhoz. The failure of the traditional political system of Europe to provide safety and security worked in the same direction since it induced the need for armaments, thus enhancing the burdens of high-pressure industrialization. The absence of the nineteenth century balance-of-power system, as well as the inability of the world market to absorb Russia’s agricultural produce, forced her reluctantly into the paths of self-sufficiency. Socialism in one country was brought about by the incapacity of market economy to provide a link between all countries ; what appeared as Russian autarchy was merely the passing of capitalist internationalism.</p>
<p>The failure of the international system let loose the energies of history — the rails were set by the tendencies inherent in a market society.</p>
