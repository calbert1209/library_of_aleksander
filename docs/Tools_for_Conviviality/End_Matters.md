## The Author

Ivan Illich (4 September 1926 – 2 December 2002)

Ivan Illich was a Catholic priest before he became a critic of industrial society.

Born in Vienna, he was forced to leave school in 1941 by the Nazis because of his mother’s Jewish ancestry. The family moved to Italy and he began studies in natural science and art history in Florence University, and in 1943 moved to Rome to study as a priest at Gregorian University. He later obtained a doctorate in history from the University of Salzburg. In 1951 he was sent as a parish priest to a Puerto Rican community in New York, to whom he became dedicated. In 1956 he was appointed vice-rector of the Catholic University of Puerto Rico and in 1959, when he was only 33 years old, he was made a Monsignor. His liberal approach, in which he taught students to question assumptions about western superiority and religious patriarchy, soon embroiled him in ecclesiastical controversy.

In 1961 he founded a centre for cross-cultural studies, in Cuernavaca, Mexico, to prepare missionaries to work in Mexico and Latin America. His radical teachings continued and his view that the Catholic Church should dissolve its bureaucracy scarcely helped his standing with the Vatican. Church funds were withdrawn from his centre. So he severed ties with the Church and resigned the priesthood. But by then he had chosen the social causes for which his centre became an international focus for intellectual debate and a respected think tank, from where Illich produced a steady flow of books and articles preaching counterintuitive sociology.

Since 1979 he divided his time between writing and teaching in Mexico, the USA, and Germany, and the international lecture circuit. He was a visiting professor of philosophy and of science, technology, and society at Penn State, and taught at the University of Bremen.

He died from cancer at home, aged 76 years in Bremen, Germany. Not realized was his last wish: to die surrounded by close collaborators in Bologna amid the creation of his planned, new learning centre.

I choose the term “conviviality” to designate the opposite of industrial productivity. I intend it to mean autonomous and creative intercourse among persons, and the intercourse of persons with their environment; and this in contrast with the conditioned response of persons to the demands made upon them by others, and by a man-made environment. I consider conviviality to be individual freedom realized in personal interdependence and, as such, an intrinsic ethical value. I believe that, in any society, as conviviality is reduced below a certain level, no amount of industrial productivity can effectively satisfy the needs it creates among society’s members.
