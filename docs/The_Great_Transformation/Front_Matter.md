The Great Transformation

KARL POLANYI

Karl Polanyi was bom in Vienna in 1886 of Hungarian parents.
He studied in the Universities of Budapest and Vienna, receiving degrees in both philosophy and law. In 1912 he was (jailed to the bar in Budapest. During the World War he served as a captain with the Austro-Hungarian army and after the war, settled in Vienna where he soon built up a distinguished reputation as a liberal writer and editor. From 1924 until 1933 he was a member of the editorial staff of Der Osterreichische Volkswirt, Vienna’s leading financial weekly. Be-
sides his constant editorial work, Dr. Polanyi published papers on theoretical economics and politics. During his time of residence in Vienna, he was lecturer at the People’s University.

The rise of the reactionary Heimwehr government forced Dr.
Polanyi’s resignation from the paper and he migrated with his family to London. He became a British citizen and continued his work as a writer and teacher. He lectured in connection with the adult educa-
tion and extension courses of Oxford University and the University of London. He was joint editor of Christianity and Social Revolution,
London, 1935, and author of The Essence of Fascism, London, 1935.

Dr. Polanyi spent the years 1940 to 1943 in the United States
where he was on the staff of Bennington College, and lectured widely.
